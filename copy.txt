I am currently a third year Digital Humanities major at Illinois tech, which is
worlds away from where I thought I'd be at this point in my life. I started my
time at Illinois Tech as an aerospace Engineering major, since it seemed like
it'd be the perfect fit for someone who'd always been involved in robotics and
space related things. In middle school I met Sally Ride, and from then to about
a year ago I was determined to become an aerospace engineer.
