  <h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  I am currently a third year Digital Humanities major at Illinois Tech, which is
  worlds away from where I thought I'd be at this point in my life. I started my
  time at Illinois Tech as an aerospace Engineering major, since it seemed like
  it'd be the perfect fit for someone who'd always been involved in robotics and
  space related things. In middle school I met Sally Ride, and from then to about
  a year ago I was determined to become an aerospace engineer.
</p>

<p>
  After three semesters as an aerospace major, I finally came to terms with the
  fact that it wasn't the right field for me. Although I'm still very interested
  in all things space-related, I know I'd much rather be in a field where I can
  actually interact with others and help people in a way that wouldn't be possible
  had I continued on the track to becoming an aerospace engineer. Now, for the
  first time since I was a child, I don't really know what I'm going to do with my
  life--career-wise, at least. I've been debating becoming anything from a teacher
  to an author or even a non-profit organizer. But for now, I'm focusing on school
  in the hopes that I'll be inspired and find my future career through my studies.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of school, I'm passionate about a lot of things, but currently one of my
  biggest passions is activism. In light of the current political climate, I think
  it's important for everyone to be involved in what's going on in our nation
  right now. Though I may be more affected by the things going on as a Muslim
  immigrant, I believe that we cannot just sit and watch while atrocities are
  being committed. Along the same lines, I'm also very passionate about advocating
  for those who cannot advocate for themselves. Living and visiting my home
  country of Pakistan throughout my life showed me how fortunate I have been to
  have grown up here in the US. I've come to realize that a lot of people
  throughout the world and even here in the US have not been as fortunate as I
  have, and I want to do anything I can to help them. This was a major part of why
  I changed my major to a more human-centric field.
</p>

<p>
  Apart from all of that, I love to read books and enjoy writing as well. I also
  love to express myself through many different forms of art, including drawing,
  painting, and experimenting with makeup. I also love listening to music, and am
  a huge fan of Fall Out Boy. I enjoy visiting new places and spend an
  embarrassing amount of my paychecks trying new food at different restaurants.
